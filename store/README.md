# STORE

This directory contains your Vuex Store files.
Vuex Store option is implemented in the Nuxt.js framework.

Creating a file in this directory automatically activates the option in the framework.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/vuex-store).

## Structure

Each file is a namespaced module of vuex store, in this directory. `index.ts` is the global state and the rest are modules.
Every module has it's own state, getters, actions and mutations. 

Literals used to name the actions and mutations in each store, for the convenience of readablity and ease of editing.
